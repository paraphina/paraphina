# Paraphina research harness dependencies.
# Keep this conservative and stable across servers.
# Note: We intentionally pin NumPy < 2 to avoid ABI issues with native extensions
# that may be installed system-wide (apt) on research boxes.

numpy<2
pandas<3

# Optional but commonly used by experiment scripts / plots:
matplotlib<4

# Utilities (safe pure-Python):
tqdm>=4.0
